    <h1 class="main-headers "> Page Three - Breakfast </h1>
    <p class="all-scenarios "> You walk to the canteen, still not fully accustomed to the camraderie and tone of life in your new home - home enough as it could be, anyway. There were no friends here, people kept away from you, you didn't do anything to be known for anyway. Walking
        into the canteen, you walk to the same line as you had for the last year or so while being highly cognizant of the phone - the contraband. You think yourself lucky to be so early in line. After a few minutes of waiting you commit yourself to the
        idea of the same breakfast you had everyday since being admitted - standard cereal. You wish they had the sugar you used to sneak on top of the cereal when you were young. Your phone buzzes again.</p>

        <li class="all-choices ">
            <a href="">You don't worry about the phone - eating is the most important thing right now, and getting caught
                is not what you need right now</a>
